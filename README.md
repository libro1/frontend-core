# Libro-1

This app's goal is to keep track of your expenses, and save (or not) money xD.

## Why is it called Libro1?
>Because my dad uses Excel to write down the expenses, and has the default name for a new Excel file in spanish ("Book 1" in English).

## Where did Libro1's idea come from?
>This file "libro1," that my dad uses, has over 5k of rows and many many years of usage.
>Now the time has come to finally improve it!
>And learn some cool stuff by doing so too.
